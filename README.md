## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Assuming you have a running [Bencher](https://github.com/LeoIV/bencher) container, you can run VES on the Mopta08 benchmark with the following command:

## Additional Information

For more details on parameters and usage, refer to the code documentation and comments.

```bash
python3 -m ves.main --benchmark mopta08 --exponential_family False \
--num_paths 128 --lengthscale_prior vbo --num_bo_iter 200 --reg_lambda 1"
```
